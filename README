### ParselTrack-Core

This is a repository of service API modules, documents recommending third-party service provider plugins, and service provider plugins written by the ParselTrack Project team which are consider core functionality for the ParselTrack Project.  
While all of these things are pluggable in a way which allows them to be replaced in the framework, it is recommended that ParselTrack be installed with the components in ParselTrack-Core.
Please review https://github.com/ParselTrack/Specifications to find the latest versions of ParselTrack Enhancement Protocol 2 (PTEP 2), PTEP 3, and PTEP 4.
PTEP 2 documents the basic concept for the framework and services API layer for ParselTrack.  PTEP 3 documents the API used for implementing service API modules.  PTEP 4 documents recommendations for writing services providers or wrappers for third-party providers which are compatible with ParselTrack.

Current development status is WIP/On-Hold.  We are in the process of documenting the ParselTrack specification.
